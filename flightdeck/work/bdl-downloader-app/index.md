## State

Product and architecture decisions are captured in local flightdeck knowledge. The app has not been scaffolded yet.

## Next

Execute Task 1 in `plan.md`: scaffold the Rust/Tauri workspace and verify `cargo check --workspace` plus the initial frontend build.

## Progress

Current:
- Created the initial flightdeck deck.
- Captured BDL product flow and architecture decisions.
- Moved durable design material into `flightdeck/knowledge/bdl-downloader/`.
- Wrote the phased implementation plan in `flightdeck/work/bdl-downloader-app/plan.md`.

Decisions:
- Main navigation: `解析`, `传输`, `历史`, `设置`; account lives in the top-right account button.
- Core pipeline: `Input -> Resolver -> NormalizedDownloadPlan -> TaskQueue -> Downloader -> PostProcess -> History`.
- Frontend consumes normalized DTOs only; Rust backend owns business state and transfer state.
- Download engine is custom around `reqwest`/`tokio`, with a future `Fetcher` trait for optional alternate backends.
- Resume is resource-level, with URL refresh through `bpi-rs` when CDN URLs expire.
